# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. This project is pre-1.0: anything may change, and the
SQLite schema under `GRASK_HOME` carries no migration guarantee yet.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) once there is a 1.0 to be compatible with.

## 0.1.0-rc3

- **Fix: the first `/grask` question call failed.** The skill described options as `label` +
  `preview`, but the question tool's schema requires `label` and `description` — `preview` is the
  optional one. A faithful first call omitted a required field and was rejected; the model only
  recovered by guessing a `description` on the retry. The skill now specifies all three fields and
  defines `description` as a mechanical continuation of the stored option text, so the new field
  cannot leak which option holds.

## 0.1.0-rc2

- **Runs on Python 3.8+ (was 3.12+).** The 3.12 floor was almost entirely accidental: the only
  hard blocker was `datetime.UTC` (a 3.11 alias for `timezone.utc`) plus one use of PEP 695 type
  syntax, both since removed. `grask doctor` now gates on `python3 ≥ 3.8`. This matters because
  the plugin runs on whatever `python3` the machine has — on a pyenv box that can be 3.9, where
  the old code crashed every hook on import. Ruff now targets `py38` so 3.9+ syntax cannot creep
  back in; the suite runs green on 3.8 and 3.14.
- **Plugin runtime no longer uses `uv`.** The plugin now runs grask with plain
  `env PYTHONPATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src" python3 -m grask.…` — no virtualenv, no build,
  no `uv`. grask has no third-party dependencies and reaches the model through the `claude`
  binary, so the venv machinery (and the `SessionStart` pre-warm that only existed to hide its
  cold-start latency) paid for a runtime grask does not have. The one requirement is now a
  `python3 ≥ 3.8`, which `grask doctor` gates on in place of the old `uv on PATH` check.
  Standalone (`uv tool install grask`) is unchanged.
- **Fix: `/grask` under a plugin-only install.** The skill called a bare `grask`, which the
  plugin deliberately does not put on PATH — so `/grask` failed for anyone who installed the
  plugin without also `uv tool install grask`. `SessionStart` now writes an executable runner
  shim (`grask shim --root`) that the skill invokes; the skill falls back to a PATH `grask` for
  the standalone install.
- **`grask doctor` understands the plugin.** The runner shim is the plugin's fingerprint, so a
  plugin-only install no longer reports its skill and capture hook as missing.

## 0.1.0-rc1

First public version. Everything below is new, so this entry describes what exists rather
than what changed.

- **Capture.** A `SessionEnd` hook spawns a detached worker that runs four stages —
  extract, triage, select, seed, probe — and stores at most one question per session.
  Most sessions store nothing.
- **Delivery.** `grask` in a terminal, and `/grask` inside Claude Code via a skill that
  `grask skill --install` writes into place. Both invoke the same graded ask.
- **Grading.** Mechanical. The answer key is minted with the question, so answering costs
  no model call and there is no judge.
- **Storage.** SQLite under `GRASK_HOME` (default `~/.claude/grask/`). Seeds are stored
  separately from probes, so a better prompt can re-ask the whole corpus later.

Not built: resurfacing a missed question, and cross-session dedup — two sessions can
currently produce near-identical probes.
